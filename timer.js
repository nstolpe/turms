'use strict'

/**
 * Sets up a self-adjusting timer. Based on code from the link below:
 * https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-accurate-timers-in-javascript/
 *
 * @param duration    The full duration of the timer in ms.
 *                    Once reached, `instance.end()` will be called.
 *
 * @param interval    The interval of time in ms after which the timer will.
 *                    adjust itself to better match duration.
 *                    2 seems to be the lower limit, 1 slow down the timer.
 *
 * @param onEnd       The function called when duration has expired.
 *                     Without this the timer won't do anything noticeable.
 *                    Called with `instance` set to `this`.
 *
 * @param onInterval  An optional function to be called on each step of the timer.
 *                    Called with `instance` set to `this`.
 *                    Calling `instance.cancel()` here doesn't work.
 *
 * @TODO Make this use `process.hrtime` instead of `new Date().getTime()` and compare
 *       with epsilon before running next step for accuracy.
